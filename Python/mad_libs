A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream! A panther’s 8 in front of my head! I 9 his 10 breath. I remember I have a packet of 11 that makes go into a deep slumber! I 12 it away from me in front of the 13.Yes he's eating it! I 14 away through the 15 jungle. I meet my parents at the tent. Phew! It’s been an exciting day in the jungle.
